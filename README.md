# Web Themes Framework
_**Quickly create themes for popular web apps.**_

## How to use
1. Download source files from https://github.com/sammilucia/web-themes-framework/archive/master.zip
2. Edit css/_theme.css
3. Edit colors and fonts to match your theme
4. To test, enable Developer Mode in Chrome or Firefox, and install as an unpacked Extension ðŸ˜Š

_Note: The license allows you to repackage and upload as a Chrome Extension/Firefox Add-on for your own theme ðŸ˜Š_

_Note2: The default theme is based on Paranoid Android by [niivu](https://www.deviantart.com/niivu/art/Paranoid-Android-Windows-10-Themes-821696974)_

## About
The goal of this project is that theme creators can create _their own_ Chrome Extension that themes the most popular websites, and package these as a Chrome extension, quickly, reliably, and easily, and without any programming experience or knowledge.

## Why, when there are others?
There are Extensions such as Stylish which let you theme specific websites, but they're not aimed at _themers_â€”You can't release your own Extension that other people can easily use.

Secondly, I'm not a fan of Extensions that have access to _all_ the websites you visit, expecially if the Extensions aren't open source.

Thirdly â€“ and perhaps the biggest reason â€“ tools like Stylish are a LOT of work, which has to be repeated for every theme. The idea of WTF is all the hard work is done for youâ€”you just put in colours and fonts and DONE ðŸ˜Š.

Lastly, WTF has minimal access to website, is completely open source, and is free to customize and distribute with your own themes.

## Attribution
If you can mention "Web Themes Framework" when you release this will help people find this project and make more themes ðŸ˜Š (but it's not necessary to mention).
